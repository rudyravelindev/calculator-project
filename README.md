## Calculator Project

This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations and has an interactive user interface.

### Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Clear button to reset the calculator.
- Decimal point input for floating-point numbers.
- Responsive user interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and equals.

### Project Steps

1. **Create Basic Math Functions**:
   - Implement functions for the following operations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
   - Test them in the browser console.

2. **Define Calculator Variables**:
   - Create variables to store the first number, operator, and second number for a calculator operation.

3. **Implement `operate` Function**:
   - Build a function that takes an operator and two numbers and calls the appropriate math function.

4. **Build the Calculator Layout in HTML**:
   - Create buttons for digits (`0-9`), operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and an equals (`=`) button.
   - Include a display for showing inputs and results.

5. **Add Clear Button**:
   - Create a "clear" (`C`) button to reset the display and internal values.

6. **Handle Button Clicks**:
   - Write functions to capture clicks on number buttons and update the display.

7. **Perform Calculations**:
   - Store and manage inputs (first number, operator, second number).
   - Perform the calculation when the equals (`=`) button is pressed and display the result.

8. **Chaining Calculations**:
   - Allow the user to perform multiple calculations in sequence, using the result of one operation as the first number for the next.

9. **Round Decimal Results**:
   - Round long decimal results to prevent overflowing the display.

10. **Error Handling**:
    - Handle division by zero by displaying an error message.
    - Prevent invalid operations like pressing equals without all inputs.

### Extra Features (Optional)
- **Decimal Input**: Add a decimal (`.`) button to allow floating-point input, ensuring only one decimal per number.
- **Backspace Functionality**: Include a backspace button to delete the last digit entered.
- **Keyboard Support**: Enable keyboard input for numbers, operators, and other functions.
- **Styling**: Improve the calculator's appearance with CSS, highlighting operators in a different color.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-project.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
